All data here comes from DoOR 2.0.1.

- we use "receptor_responses_onlyOR.csv" in our analysis, together with "receptor_labels_onlyOR.txt" and "odorant_labels.txt"
- "or.csv" (e.g. ab2B.csv) are the responses taken directly from the ref papers
- "door_response_matrix.csv" are responses normalized over all ORs/odorants
- "door_response_matrix_non_normalized.csv" are responses normalized only over subgroup (which one?)
- odor "SFR" is the spontaneous firing rate, which DoOR uses to normalize different datasets
- odor "none" is just a row with all responses set to zero
